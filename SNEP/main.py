# Stock News Email Application

STOCK = "TSLA"
COMPANY_NAME = "Tesla Inc"

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
# parameters = {
#     "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
#     "symbol": STOCK,
#     "interval":"60min",
#     "outputsize":"compact",
#     "apikey":API_KEY,
    
    
# }
# url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query'
# r = requests.get(url, params=parameters)
# data = r.json()

# # print(data["Time Series (Daily)"]["2024-07-25"]["1. open"])
# # print(float(data["Time Series (Daily)"]["2024-07-26"]["1. open"])-float(data["Time Series (Daily)"]["2024-07-25"]["1. open"]))

# # d = {"1": 12, "2": 12}
# # first = dict(islice(d.items(), 1))
# # print(first)

# # yesterdayStockPrice : int 
# # twoDaysAgoStockPrice : int


# first_three = dict(islice(data["Time Series (Daily)"].items(),3))
# yesterdayOpen = first_three["yesterday"]["1. open"]
# dayBeforeYesterdayOpen = first_three["dayBeforeYesterday"]["1. open"]

# percentageIncrease = ((yesterdayOpen-dayBeforeYesterdayOpen)/dayBeforeYesterdayOpen) * 100

# if (abs(percentageIncrease) >= 5 ):
#     print("Get News, Something happened!!!!")




 



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

## STEP 3: Use SMTP TO email yourself
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number.

            msg=f"Subject:{COMPANY_NAME} News\n\nTSLA percentage increase here \nHeadline:{title} \nUrl:{url}"
        )
    print("Success")
except:
